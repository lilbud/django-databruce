Features?

<!-- Event search by date? -->
<!-- advanced event search -->
<!-- setlist search (done but incredibly finicky)  -->
<!-- limit to one item max, so a single song anywhere/song preceded or followed by/etc -->
<!-- Change everything in API view back to querysets for the time being
        later on look into adding in an actual API, but for now, QS will do. -->

Combine setlist search and event search
event search first to whittle down the list of events, then pass that filtered list to
the setlist search. So, it only looks from that filtered list instead of everything.

<!-- Clean up setlist search, look into way to do lag/lead in Django ORM -->

Setlist Page: add toggle to hide private events like soundcheck/rehearsal/recording

Cleanup:

<!-- cleanup and finish EVENTS page, add setlist note numbers to songs -->

Home Page:

<!-- get list of today in history events -->

Songs:
add snippets? separate page with its own stats
songs only played as snippet?

Song Page:

<!-- add tabview -->
<!-- second tab will be times it appeared as a snippet
        mostly done -->

Last:
figure out a logo
Better styling
