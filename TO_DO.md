# Pages to add:
- Songs played as snippets
- Events by Run
- Radio Nowhere Archive page

# Features?
<!-- - Event search by date? -->

- advanced event search - DONE
  - every field has a default of all values so if they're left empty it will still work.

- Clean up setlist search
  - cleaned up the form, "followed by" properly added and hides when not needed
  - still limited to a single song, but might be able to expand

- Combine setlist search and event search
  - event search first to whittle down the list of events, then pass that filtered list to the setlist search. So, it only looks from that filtered list instead of everything.

<!-- - Song Page: add toggle to hide private events like soundcheck/rehearsal/recording -->

# Other
- Clean up release tracks page, add musicbrainz links and art
- style pages to use cards like setlist page
- finish setlist page, add venue/city links and show info like title/type/run/tour. Also add nugs/release links/archive
<!-- figure out a logo -->
Better styling
