# Pages to add:
<!-- - Event Run Details
  - events, songs -->
<!-- - Tour Legs -->
<!-- - Tour Leg Details?
  - events, songs -->
<!-- - Setlist Notes Search -->

# Features?
- Event page layout improvements
  - clean up setlist notes. Some events (like 2016-01-16) have a ridiculous number of notes, all of which are debut/premiere/bustout. Find another way to display this info. Could maybe do a table like Dripfield, but that doesn't quite work on mobile. They use tooltips with links to indicate last show, which jump to that event when tapped on mobile.
  - nugs/releases/archive links
  - notes
  - album breakdown

- Songs page additions? likely dropdowns or maybe incorporate the sidebar filter that dripfield does?
  - Songs only played as snippets (if snip_only is true)
  - Songs never played live (all num columns == 0)

- Release Tracks
  - add musicbrainz links

# Other
<!-- - move tours to a dropdown on navbar? tours/legs -->
- Clean up release tracks page, add musicbrainz links and art
<!-- - style pages to use cards like setlist page -->
<!-- - finish setlist page, add venue/city links and show info like title/type/run/tour.  -->
<!-- figure out a logo -->
<!-- Better styling -->
