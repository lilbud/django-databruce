stuff from original:
	general layout
	recent events on homepage
	same basic pages
		events both by tour and year
		venues
		relations/bands
		search (adv event and setlist search)

stuff to remove:
	event date quick search
		perhaps find another way to do the select2 dropdown, or just get rid of that part of it
	
stuff to change:
	event year/tour pages
		figure out how to do the el goose style, but without it taking too long to load everything
	
new:
	somehow get a template for the table to control classes for all of them
